## Overview
This project explores ten years of lightning strike across the United States from 2009 to 2018. The goal was to visualize long-term trends in strike frequency, identify the most active regions, and compare local patterns using embedded maps.

This project began as a Tableau learning exercise, but the original tutorial contained configuration issues that prevented the filters from updating the total, average and maximum strike values. I identified the problem and adjusted the setup, and refined the dashboard so it behaved as intended.

## Abilities
- [x] Interactive dashboard design using multiple Tableau worksheets
- [x] Data exploration and summary statistics
- [x] Data visualization using charts and maps
- [x] Clear and concise data storytelling

## Key Insights
- Lightning activity shows a notable upward trend in total annual strikes.
- Geographic concentration of strikes shifted westward toward the Central Mainlands.
- Local maps of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas reveal strong clustering in densely populated household areas.

## Limits

This project doesnot investigate the underlying causes or regional variations.
